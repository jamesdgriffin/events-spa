Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:

Disclaimer: I did not have much time to work on this assignment last week, and
unfortunately had to travel back to my hometown on Friday (away from my
development machine), and therefore did not turn this assignment in at that
time. I have since returned and have put this submission together with the hopes
of not bombing my grade with a 0 on this assignment. Although this submission is
lacking, I truly do feel that I would be able to complete this assignment and
all required functionality if I had the time. Thank you for reading.

1. What's your name?
James Griffin


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/yono-oko/events-spa


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events-spa.jimbot.io


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
No. The React and Elixir apps both work correctly on own, however I was not
able to connect the two when deploying. Some functionality is missing from the
application, including passwords and some access control (anyone can view any
event).


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
No. I was unable to deploy the api side of the application correctly. I believe
if I had more time I would be able to determine what went wrong and how to fix
it, however I want to turn this HW in ASAP as it is already late.
